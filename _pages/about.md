Hi there! I'm Milad Mesbahi, a recent UCLA graduate with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, now diving into the world of robotics at UPenn for my Masters. I'm on a mission to use my education to empower people and communities around the globe, though I'm still figuring out exactly how that'll manifest in my career.

On the technical side, my main interests reside in using robotics and autonomous systems to solve complex problems. I am currently taking courses that deal with computational robotics, machine perception and machine learning, and I would love to continue excelling in these areas for any future work I am a part of. Multi-agent and GNC problems that contain machine perception and use machine learning algorithms to solve them are what particularly excite me.

Alongside this, I have many complementary interests in the fields of history, economics, and philosophy. I believe that possessing an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for engineers to possess as we collectively combat 21st-century problems, especially as we grapple with the ethical implications of emerging technologies. 

As I progress in my career, I'll be updating this website to share my journey, showcase my projects, and document where my life path takes me. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my vision for using technology to create positive change.

Stay tuned as I navigate the intersection of robotics, social impact, and innovation. Please feel free to reach out as well!
