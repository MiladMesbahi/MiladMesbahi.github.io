Hi there! I'm Milad Mesbahi, a recent UCLA graduate with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, now diving into the world of robotics at UPenn for my Masters. I'm on a mission to use my education to empower people and communities around the globe, though I'm still figuring out exactly how that'll manifest in my career.

I'm a passionate learner with complimentary interests in history, economics, and philosophy. I believe having an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for engineers to possess as we collectivly combat 21st-century problems, especially as we grapple with the ethical implications of emerging technologies. 

As I progress in my career, I'll be updating this website to share my journey, showcase my projects, and document where my life path takes me. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my vision for using technology to create positive change.

Stay tuned as I navigate the intersection of robotics, social impact, and innovation. Please feel free to reach out as well!
