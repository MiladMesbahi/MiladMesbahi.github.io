As a team of 2, we engineered a 1-pound combat robot, focusing on balancing durability and agility. Using high-quality aluminum, I optimized the strength-to-weight ratio while maintaining structural integrity. This was done using force analysis, center of mass calculations and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). 

The robot's standout feature was an 'egg beater' weapon, comprising 30% of the total mass, designed to undercut opponents effectively. Although manually controlled via Bluetooth, we ensured robust electronic setup and protection for intense combat scenarios. Leveraging our FEM, I reinforced structural weak points, leading to iterative improvements. 

Our compact and strategic design earned a notable second place in a highly competitive competition.
