In my final project for a Computer Aided Design (CAD) course at UCLA, I designed a robotic manipulator with the help of three other students. The design was inspired by an octopus tentacle's flexibility, suitable for manufacturing. 

We adhered to seven key specifications, including achieving six degrees of freedom, emulating ball joint mobility, and maximizing joint motion range while ensuring design simplicity with axial revolution, planar rotation, and Servo-Motor CAD. The final design featured five subassemblies, using a mix of off-the-shelf parts and 3D-printed ABS thermoplastic components. 

Although the initial design met basic criteria, future iterations could focus on increased joint complexity, weight optimization, and advanced manufacturing techniques.
