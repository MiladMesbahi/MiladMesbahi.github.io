As the former lead researcher in the Thermosciences Lab, I specialized my research in the experimental study of how string morphology and tension influence the behavior of liquid desiccants. My research involved a series of stress tests on cotton strings to analyze how different tension levels affect the formation, movement, and stability of beads along the string surface. I conduct controlled experiments to systematically validate the response of these beads to varying tensions, investigating how these responses impact fluid flow characteristics, such as bead spacing, velocity, and droplet formation. These fluid fow characteristic are the cornerstone of this lab's research, and thus much of my research was highlighting a component that may have been missed by former researchers.

 I also engineered and fabricated precise experimental setups that enabled the controlled manipulation of string tension, allowing us to observe real-time changes in string morphology and fluid behavior. Additionally, I developed image processing algorithms in MATLAB to automate the analysis of these experiments, accurately capturing string curvature under different tensions and quantifying the impact on fluid dynamics. This automation makes fluid dynamic analysis much easier for the lab and is a algorithim other student researchers will continue to use. These efforts helped advanced the lab's understanding of tension effects in liquid desiccant systems, and a paper on these results in currently in the works of being published.
