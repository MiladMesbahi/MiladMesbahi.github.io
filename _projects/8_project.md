In this project, I designed and manufactured a chair component by applying both manual and CNC machining techniques. Working with lathes and milling machines for the first time, I learned to measure precisely, select optimal feed rates, and apply careful machining techniques to produce parts that met tight tolerances. I quickly adapted to challenges, such as correcting overcuts caused by improper feed rates and readjusting setups to prevent tool and workpiece damage.

For the CNC machining portion, I programmed and optimized G-code using SolidCAM, focusing on efficient toolpath planning, feed rate adjustments, and sequencing of operations to minimize tool changes and machining time. I learned to calibrate equipment properly, ensure workpiece alignment, and manage the dynamics of machining operations to achieve high-quality, accurate results. 

This project allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of both manual and automated machining processes, and through this experience and the corresponding class, I have a much better understanding on engineering to manufacture.
