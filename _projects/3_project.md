In my first hands-on robotics venture, I designed and built an autonomous rover capable of navigating an obstacle course. Using SolidWorks, I developed a robust chassis to house all components efficiently. Our grabbing mechanism used rubberized clampers for object retrieval. 

The project extensively employed 3D printing and laser cutting for all of our parts, utilizing Prusa slicer software and UCLA's facilities to create components such as our motor mounts and battery pack holders. 

I also spearheaded programming, optimizing Arduino code for intelligent navigation and decision-making.
