I designed and optimized a MEMS-based micro-mirror system with a single translational degree of freedom for high-precision optical applications. Utilizing the Freedom and Constraint Topologies (FACT) framework from Professor Jonathan Hopkins and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), I developed a micro-mirror system that incorporated six wire flexures and two parallel plate actuators, enabling precise light modulation with minimal parasitic motion and a maximum displacement of 125 micrometers. 

I optimized the design through simulations and MATLAB stiffness matrix models, achieving high resonance frequencies and reducing unwanted modal interactions. The planned fabrication would have employed advanced microfabrication techniques, including Deep Reactive-Ion Etching (DRIE) and photolithography, to create the micro-mirror with precise dimensions and robust structural integrity.
