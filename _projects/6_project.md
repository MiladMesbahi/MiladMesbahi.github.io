I developed a controller for an active car suspension system using MATLAB and Simulink, focusing on minimizing vehicle oscillations to enhance passenger comfort. 

This project involved creating a quarter-car model, deriving transfer functions through the application of Laplace transforms, and analyzing system stability. I employed various control theory techniques, including Bode plots, Nyquist diagrams, and root locus analysis, to design feedback controllers and compensators that met specific performance criteria, such as limiting maximum overshoot to 5% and achieving a settling time of less than one second. 

Additionally, I utilized MATLAB's SISOTOOL to fine-tune the compensator design, successfully achieving a controlled response to road disturbances.
