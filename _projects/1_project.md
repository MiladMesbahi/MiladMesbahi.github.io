As my senior capstone project at UCLA, our team of five built a rover over two quarters. Designed to navigate an obstacle course, the rover identified, collected, and delivered burger-forming discs using IR sensors and computer vision. 

As the mechanical design lead and co-lead for programming, I ensured robust structure and functionality within a $500 budget. The Mecanum wheel drive system provided omnidirectional movement, and a stepper motor-controlled claw handled stacking. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and OpenCV, the computer vision system detected die numbers on discs for collection order and drop-off location. 

Our rover successfully completed the course, being the only group to use camera software for die number detection.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
