During my internship at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), I focused on evaluating chainmail solids as a new material for shock mitigation and vibrational damping in aerospace applications. I designed and conducted a series of experiments to assess the capabilities of chainmail structures compared to various control comparisons. Using a data acquisition system and customized testing setup with accelerometers on an eletric shaker, I performed random vibrational analysis, sweeping across frequencies from 20Hz to 2000Hz. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in vibration transmissibility, with the chainmail achieving up to a 98% reduction at critical frequencies, effectively attenuating vibrational energy to 1% of the control block's response.

To further analyze the vibrational behavior of the chainmail, I developed MATLAB algorithms for post-signal processing that examined various traits such as magnitude, coherence, phase, power spectral density (PSD), and mode shapes. These algorithms enabled detailed visualization and interpretation of the modal behavior by generating graphical representations, which were helpful for the dynamics department to better understand the chainmail's performance. 

I also applied Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations to predict and validate the behavior of the chainmail structures under various dynamic conditions, confirming their effectiveness in damping vibrations. I also optimized the experimental setup to accurately isolate the damping properties of the chainmail, ensuring that the data collected reflected its true performance. Lastly, I explored the tunability of the chainmail structure, analyzing its capacity to adapt its natural modes to specific applications, and investigated its unique translational and rotational response characteristics.
